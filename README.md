# Exploring pandas

This is a repository of exercises done for our Data class at the Columbia Journalism School’s Lede Program, which can also work as a basic cheat sheet for quick reference. 

The exercises require two datasets: `animals.csv` and `richpeople.xlsx`. Although not utilized in the exercises, `billionaires.json` — which was pulled from [Bloomberg’s Billionaires List](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires) — may serve as another valuable resource for data wrangling and `pd` exercise.

Libraries used in the exercises are `pandas` as `pd` _(obviously!)_, `matplotlib`, and `openpyxl`.

### animals.csv

The dataset shows a simple list of cats and dogs, their names, and length (in cm). Use this to explore basic `pd` functions.

### richpeople.xlsx

The spreadsheet shows 2014 data on billionaires, including their net worth, age, type of wealth, company, and sector. The wealth of data points can be instructive for data wrangling and analysis exercises.
